### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jason and I am currently a Unix Systems Engineer based in San Francisco, CA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. 

As an engineer I like to:

* build tooling that supports internal users
* enforce corporate security
* deploy scalable infrastructure.

I'm currently looking to collaborate on building open source tools using terraform and Go that might be somewhat useful both in professional and personal settings.
